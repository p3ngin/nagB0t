'''
Program to initialize GUI on time delay to validate various things have been done. Currently is built for 1 parameter (exercise).
Goal is to have 3+ different parameters in different pop-up windows to validate various things are being done and run in the background
until all parameters are completed. Time delay on hiding windows and showing again will eventually be increased to multiple hours.

*Will run on startup and run in background throughout day.
